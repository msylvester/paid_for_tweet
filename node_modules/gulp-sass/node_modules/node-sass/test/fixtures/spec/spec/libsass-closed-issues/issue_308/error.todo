WARNING on line 7, column 2 of /sass/spec/libsass-issues/issue_308/input.scss:
You probably don't mean to use the color value `orange' in interpolation here.
It may end up represented as #ffa500, which will likely produce invalid CSS.
Always quote color names when using them as strings (for example, "orange").
If you really want to use the color value here, use `"" + $var'.
